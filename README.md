# React and Django Development Environment

## System requirements

* Docker
* Docker Compose

## Project name
I would recommend you do a find and replace for all references to `proj3ctname` in this repository and rename any directories that are named `proj3ctname`.

## Instructions for development

Run `docker-compose up --build` to start development.
Run `docker-compose down` to stop development and remove this environment's containers, volumes and networks (images won't be removed).
